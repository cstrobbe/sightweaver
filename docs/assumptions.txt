Headings
- If the first row's or column's cells are bolded or anyway distinguished from 
  the other cells then assume that this row/column is a table header.
- Similarly, if other rows or columns contain text that is dissimilar to
  surrounding text (ie. bold), then this row/column is considered to also be
  significant for generating table headers.
- If the table is thought to be formatted using Word's autoformat feature,
  then the format may be used to generate header information.
- If row/column headers are missing, the table cell scope is considered to be
  'col'.

Captions/Summaries/Titles
- If a paragraph exists before or after the table with a caption style (or
  otherwise distinctly marked up then assume that this is a caption.
- If the first row in the table is a merged row consisting of a single cell
  or the first row only has content in the middle cell or left most cell, then
  assume that this cell is a caption.
- If the caption is very small, it is assumed to be a 'title' instead.
- If a header label is not in the dictionary, or is an acronym, then it is
  assumed to be an abbreviation.

General
- Assume that all tables passed to the program are data tables.
