Nov 4th:  background reading, w3c, etc
Nov 11th: sample gathering
Dec 20th: requirements and specifications draft 1
Jan 6th:  finished reqs + specs
Jan 13th: designed classes
Jan 20th: started coding - class stubs

Jan 21st: swing init
- read swing tutorial
- created tester apps
- added to SWJFrame

Jan 22nd: menus
- 3 menus in reqs + debug menu

Jan 23th: i18n
- .properties file
- replaced menus

Jan 24th: xhtml importer (xerces)
- installed xerces
- added dom imports to xhtml importer class
- hooked in debug menu to create new document using xhtml importer

Feb 7th: xhtml dom to object mapping
- preliminary mapping; tds and trs to 2d cell arrary
- summary and caption

Feb 10th-13th: displaying basic table 
- created subclass of jtable + jtablemodel
- stored reference to cells in jtablemodel
- overrode methods of jtablemodel to access cell data
- created cellrenderer to access the getcomponent method of cell
- implemented getcomponent method of cell
- headercell subclass creates bold text

Feb 16th: row + column spanning
- created nullcell class
- modified xhtmlimporter to look for colspan and rowspan
- implemented algorithm to fill table with nullcells if necessary
- subsequent cells will be added after nullcells
- check with w3c specs

Feb 17th: selection
- added mouse listener to table
- mouse listener checks cells to see if they're selected and modifieds the cell object if necessary
- updated getcomponent to return inverted colours for selected cells (which involved wrapping the textpane in a panel with no border)

Feb 18th: table scrolling + status bar
- nested tables in scrollpane to allow for large tables
- added status bar with placeholders for id, abbr, assoc, and axis
- added window title bar text

Feb 20th: status bar + table menu
- status bar now updates depending on cell(s) selected
- this required implementation of id/abbr/axis detected on cells
- also basic ("headers" attribute) header association identification
- th cells given id 
- table menu lists all tables in document

Feb 21st: menu action listener
- added action listeners for all menu items
- including table selection

Feb 25th: create cvs module
- created local cvs (concurrent versioning system) to track changes

Mar 12th: implemented html and csv importers, xhtml exporter
- implemented html importer using jtidy - with jtidy.properties file
- implemented csv importer using borrowed code
- added null preparser placeholder
- implemented xhtml exporter using jtidy's pretty print

Mar 13th: added scope and thead support to xhtmlimporter, cell display improvements, header finder algorithm, "strong" header identifier algorithm
- importer now supports 'row' and 'col' scopes on imported documents
- importer now treats cells in thead as headers
- implemented header finder algorithm for unclaimed cells
- cells now recursively display all text in a cell
- null cells (those that are spanned) display with diagonal line
- made table background white
- if no other header cells in document, cells with all text in a "strong" tag will become a header (jtidy makes a good attempt to clean "bold" and "font: bold" stuff into "strong" tags)
- exporter now exports cell attributes (cell attributes are stored in its dom element at set time)
- exporter now exports new header cells with correct tagname

Mar 14th: preparsers, misc testing & bug fixing, new menus, filters and dialogs, system l&f
- preparser support using "generator" tag (regular expression)
- fixed bug in which new headers lose references to their child cells
- misc testing & bug fixing
- added remaining menu items + descriptions + separators 
- contexted enabling of menu items based on type + number of cells selected
- added hourglass cursor when opening documents
- nested table and missing table bugs fixed
- nice dialogs for importing and exporting errors
- filters - html, csv, rdf
- view source - new frame, no separate class
- edit summary - separate dialog class, opendialogwindow, beans, etc
- system l&f

Mar 15th: misc fixes, jar testing
- testing on windows revealed table headers aren't hidden - removing these.
- ".xsl" error message
- jar testing, added manifest: "javac sightweaver/*.java && jar -cmf docs/manifest.txt sightweaver.jar sightweaver org javax"
- jar testing revealed resource bundle problem in jar files. used sightweaver. in resource bundles

Mar 18th: dialog day
- reimplemented "edit summary" dialog and implemented "edit caption", "edit header info", "edit axis" dialogs using abstract superclass

Mar 19th: dialog day 2
- implemented "add header scope" and "add header" dialog
- implemented "clear headers"
- implemented "make header" and "make data"
- fixed a bug with updating display after caption change

Mar 30th: added dialog descriptions

Apr 3rd: added mnemonics to menus and menuitems

Apr 4th: added javadoc comments

Apr 6th: added gui accessibility
- gave components accessible names where required
- gave components accessible descriptions
- linked labels to components
- checked for keyboard alternatives

Apr 7th: fixed misc bugs
- added generator tag
- added accessibility checking on  export
- added dialog descriptions
